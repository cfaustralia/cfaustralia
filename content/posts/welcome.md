some suggested ways that you can help.
### Join us on Slack
once I create a workspace...
### Writing Articles
Anything related to being childfree is welcome. If you're willing to share your story of how you came to decide to live 
a childfree life that would be great. Other suggestions for topics:

* Benefits and/or challenges you've discovered from your child free life
* Contraception
* Discrimination you've experienced because of your choice to be childfree
* Dealing with some of the less desirable reactions (how many times have you heard "you'll change your mind"!?)
### Creating Artwork
I don't have an artistic bone in my body, hence the total lack of art/images. That's great for keeping the site responsive
but looks a bit bland. If you'd like to add a logo/pics/artwork, hit me up on slack and we can talk concepts.
